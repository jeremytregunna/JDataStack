JDataStack is an implementation of a multi-context Core Data stack for iOS 5.0 and higher.

## Using

Create an instance of JDataStack like this:

    JDataStack* stack = [[JDataStack alloc] initWithDelegate:delegateObject];

Set up your delegateObject with the two required methods, something like this:

    - (void)dataStack:(JDataStack*)dataStack preflightSetupForPersistentStoreCoordinator:(NSPersistentStoreCoordinator*)persistentStoreCoordinator
    {
        URL* storeURL = [[self applicationDocumentsDirectory] URLByAppendingPathComponent:@"Personal.sqlite"];
         
        NSError* error = nil;
        if(![persistentStoreCoordinator addPersistentStoreWithType:NSSQLiteStoreType configuration:nil URL:storeURL options:nil error:&error])
        {
            [[NSFileManager defaultManager] removeItemAtURL:storeURL error:nil];
            if(![persistentStoreCoordinator addPersistentStoreWithType:NSSQLiteStoreType configuration:nil URL:storeURL options:nil error:&error])
            {
                NSLog(@"Unresolved error %@, %@", error, [error userInfo]);
                abort();
            }
        }
        
        NSDictionary* fileAttributes = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:NSFileProtectionComplete forKey:NSFileProtectionKey];
        if(![[NSFileManager defaultManager] setAttributes:fileAttributes ofItemAtPath:[storeURL path] error:&error])
        {
            NSLog(@"Unable to set file protection attribute on store. Error: %@", error);
        }

and likewise:

    - (NSURL*)modelURLForDataStack:(JDataStack*)dataStack
    {
        return [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"Personal" withExtension:@"momd"];
    }

The reason you must supply these is that JDataStack won't know what you've named your model file, or if you want an in-memory persistent store or a sqlite store. You have to set these up according to your application requirements. You can mutate (and are expected to) the `persistentStoreCoordinator` variable in the preflight delegate.

The delegate has other methods you can implement which may be useful for your purposes.

You must pass this instance around in your application. You can check out [JInjector](https://github.com/jeremytregunna/JInjector) for a simple dependency injection tool to help with this in some architectures.

If you have a lot of work to do that you'd like to do in a background context, you can get a new managed object context in a background thread by asking the stack for one:

    NSManagedObjectContext* moc = [stack newPrivateManagedObjectContext];

If you need a reference to the main managed object context:

    NSManagedObjectContext* moc = [stack mainManagedObjectContext];

There is a separate managed object context for writing to disk and it's at the similarly named:

    NSManagedObjectContext* moc = [stack writeManagedObjectContext];

Finally, you can save changes you make like so:

    [moc performBlock:^{
        NSError* error = nil;
        if(![moc save:&error])
            NSLog(@"Error: %@", error);
        [stack writeToDisk]; // Optional, only if you want to persist the changes to disk.
    }];
