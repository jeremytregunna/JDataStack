JDataStack is an implementation of a multi-context Core Data stack for iOS 5.0 and higher.

## Using

Create an instance of JDataStack like this:

    JDataStack* stack = [[JDataStack alloc] initWithModelName:@"Foo" delegate:delegateObject];

This implies that your core data model is named **Foo** and your database will be named **Foo** as well. The delegate is entirely optional, but is useful if you have fields on your objects which indicate updated times, for instance.

You must pass this instance around in your application. You can check out [JInjector](https://github.com/jeremytregunna/JInjector) for a simple dependency injection tool to help with this in some architectures.

If you have a lot of work to do that you'd like to do in a background context, you can get a new managed object context in a background thread by asking the stack for one:

    NSManagedObjectContext* moc = [stack newPrivateManagedObjectContext];

If you need a reference to the main managed object context:

    NSManagedObjectContext* moc = [stack mainManagedObjectContext];

There is a separate managed object context for writing to disk and it's at the similarly named:

    NSManagedObjectContext* moc = [stack writeManagedObjectContext];

Finally, you can save changes you make like so:

    [moc performBlock:^{
        NSError* error = nil;
        if(![moc save:&error])
            NSLog(@"Error: %@", error);
        [stack writeToDisk]; // Optional, only if you want to persist the changes to disk.
    }];
